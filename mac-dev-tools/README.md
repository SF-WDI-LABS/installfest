# Installfest Step 2: Mac Development Tools & Applications

## Text Editor

Our class will be using [Atom/Sublime](#TODO-PICK-ONE) as our preferred text editor. Please follow the installation instructions for:
<!-- TODO: PICK ONE -->
* [Atom](editor-atom.md)
* [Sublime Text 3](editor-sublime-text-3.md)

## Browser
Our class will be using Chrome as our preferred browser. If you don't already have it, please follow the installation instructions for:

* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en)

We also recommend you install the following Chrome Extensions:

* <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc" target="_blank">JSON View</a>
* <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>

## Window Manager

While programming it's pretty common to need to juggle the placement of multiple windows. To speed up this process, we'll install a program that does this for us (and gives us a bunch of convenient keyboard shortcuts).

1. Download https://raw.github.com/onsi/ShiftIt/master/ShiftIt.zip
    * Next, extract it and drag the application icon into your `Applications` directory.
    * Finally, launch the app by double-clicking the ShiftIt icon and follow the instructions to enable the accessibility options.

2. We recommend you familiarze yourself with ShiftIt commands and keyboard shortcuts, like:
* Move window to the left-half: Command+Option+Control+LeftArrow
* Move window to the right-half: Command+Option+Control+RightArrow
* **M**aximize a window: Command+Option+Control+**M**

You can try this now.

### A word on *Keyboard Shortcuts*

By the way, developers LOVE shortcut key combinations. The more shortcuts you know, the faster you can code!

For starters, you should know how to `copy`, `paste`, and `cut`. But there are tons more [Mac Shortcuts](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mac+keyboard+shortcuts&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) you should learn [how to read](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) and use!

Every single application above has its own list of shortcuts too! One way to learn them is to go through the menu bar and look at each dropdown option. 

Another option is to simply google ["sublime text 3 cheatsheet"](https://www.google.com/search?q=sublime+text+3+cheatsheet&tbm=isch) or ["atom cheatsheet"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=atom+cheat+sheet). Try it!

The best way to learn keyboard shortcuts is to _STOP USING YOUR MOUSE_. Cover it with a piece of paper! Tape a list of shortcuts next to your screen!
